	<h1>Welcome to the Ninjas Page of Assignment II!</h1>
	<h2>History of the Ninja</h2>
	<p>From Asian History, on About.com: Black-clad figures with muffled faces skitter through a courtyard, swarming over walls like spiders and running lightly across rooftops, quick as cats.</p>
	<p>An unsuspecting samurai sleeps peacefully as these shadows permanently silence his body guards. The bedroom door slides open without a sound, an up-raised blade glints in the moonlight, and...</p>
	<p>This is the ninja of the movies and comic books, the stealthy assassin in black robes with magical abilities in the arts of concealment and murder. This wraith-like being is very compelling, to be sure. But what is the historical reality behind the popular culture icon of the Ninja?</p>

	<h2>Origins of the Ninja:</h2>
	<p>It is difficult to pin down the emergence of the first ninja, more properly called shinobi. After all, people around the world have always used spies and assassins.</p>
	<p>Japanese folklore states that the ninja descended from a demon that was half man and half crow. However, it seems more likely that the ninja slowly evolved as an opposing force to their upper-class contemporaries, the samurai, in early feudal Japan.</p>
	<p>Most sources indicate that the skills that became ninjutsu, the ninja's art of stealth, began to develop between 600-900 A.D. Prince Shotoku, (574-622), is said to have employed Otomono Sahito as a shinobi spy.</p>

	<h2>Women as Ninjas?</h2>
	<p>Women also served in ninja combat. Female ninja, or kunoichi, infiltrated enemy castles in the guise of dancers, concubines or servants. They were successful spies, and sometimes acted as assassins as well.</p>
	
	<h2>Ninja Clothing, Tools and Weapons:</h2>
	<p>In modern movies and comic books, ninjas are portrayed in all-black clothing, with only their eyes showing. This costume, however, comes from the kabuki theater.</p>
	<p>Actual ninjas wore navy blue for night operations, because it is harder to see on a dark night. Usually, however, they dressed to blend in with their targets - as any sensible espionage agent would do. They dressed as farmers, peddlers, foot soldiers, or actors, depending on their objective.</p>
	<p>Ninja tools and weapons included: shinobigatana, medium-length swords; the bo and naginata, war staves and pikes; and martial arts like karate. Ninja also developed special equipment like the shuko, an iron hand-crampon used for climbing, and the tessen, a sharpened metal fan.</p>

	<h2>Ninjas Nowadays:</h2>
	<p>There are different kinds of ninjas nowadays.</p>
	<p>Cleaning Ninjas, Mortal Combat Ninjas, Cartoon Ninjas, Teenage Mutan Ninja Turtles, Ninjas in video games and movies, Cheerleader Ninjas and Coding Ninjas. The list is endless. For Ninjas to be stealthy and hold their spy-ness, they sure need to work on their art of concealment </p>
