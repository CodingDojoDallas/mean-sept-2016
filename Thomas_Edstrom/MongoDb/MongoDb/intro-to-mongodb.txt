1. Create a database called 'my_first_db'.

	use my_first_db

2. Create students collection.

	db.createCollection("students")

3. Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: {name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}}

	...ok?

4. Create 5 students with the appropriate info.

	db.students.insert({name: "Bob", home_state: "TX", lucky_number: 1, birthday: {month: 1, day: 5, year: 1970}})
	db.students.insert({name: "Carl", home_state: "CO", lucky_number: 2, birthday: {month: 2, day: 10, year: 1975}})
	db.students.insert({name: "Henry", home_state: "NY", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 3, day: 15, year: 1980}})
	db.students.insert({name: "Larry", home_state: "WA", lucky_number: 4, birthday: {month: 4, day: 20, year: 1985}})
	db.students.insert({name: "Joe", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 5, birthday: {month: 5, day: 25, year: 1990}})

5. Get all students.

	db.students.find()

6. Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).

	db.students.find({home_state: "CA"})

7. Get all students whose lucky number is:
	A. greater than 3

		db.students.find({lucky_number: 3})

	B. less than or equal to 10

		db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

	C. between 1 and 9 (inclusive)

		db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}})

8. Add a field in each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

	db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ["coding", "brunch", "MongoDB"]}})

9. Add some unique interests for each particular students into each of their interest arrays.

	db.students.update({name: "Bob"}, {$push: {interests: "golf"} })
	db.students.update({name: "Carl"}, {$push: {interests: "collecting toenails"} })
	db.students.update({name: "Henry"}, {$push: {interests: "eating grass"} })
	db.students.update({name: "Larry"}, {$push: {interests: "exotic sleeping"} })
	db.students.update({name: "Joe"}, {$push: {interests: "naked skydiving"} })

10. Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.

	db.students.update({name: "Joe"}, {$push: {interests: "taxes"} })

11. Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.

	db.students.update({name: "Joe"}, {$pull: {interests: "taxes"} })

12. Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).

	db.students.deleteMany({$or: [{home_state: "CA"}, {home_state: "WA"}]})

13. Remove a user by name. 

	db.students.deleteOne({name: "Henry"})

14. Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)

	db.students.deleteOne({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}})

15. Add a field in each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.

	db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

16. Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).

	db.students.update({home_state: "WA"}, { $inc: { number_of_belts: 1 } })

17. Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'

	db.students.updateMany( {}, { $rename: { "number_of_belts": "belts_earner" } } )

18. Remove the 'lucky_number' field.

	db.students.updateMany({}, { $unset: { lucky_number: "" } })

19. Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.

	db.students.updateMany({}, { $currentDate: { updated_on: { $type: "date" }}})
